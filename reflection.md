I worked on this site page by page, starting with the index. First, I created a template structure including what I needed on every page. This included the standard setup as well as the "Pages" section at the bottom of every page. Throughout the development of this, I made sure to keep track of everything I had included so far, including number of images, content types, and colors. I also ensured that every image had an alt attribute. I made use of the <b> and <i> tags often to add personality to the page, as I couldn't use CSS. The main difficulty I faced was with the links once I moved two files into a different directory. I thought it would be sufficient to add "./hiking/" before those two files, but when I tried to access other pages not in that directory, it didn't work. To solve this, I added "../" before the files not in that directory to go to the previous directory. Overall, this project was both fun and frustrating, as I've never tried to make a website without CSS and JavaScript. I found myself wanting to use CSS especially for many things.
